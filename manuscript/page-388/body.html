But look here, Barbara darling; you'll come out for a drive with me whenever I fetch you?"</p><p>"Oh, thanks, Alice; I'm too far out of your way to be fetched often."</p><p>"Not a bit, Barbara; what else have the horses to do? though it is a difficult place to find out. Edwards—the coachman, I mean—had never heard of it, though he knows all sorts of short cuts; and we had to ask our way perpetually."</p><p>Barbara had something on the tip of her tongue, but it was never framed into words. She contented herself with saying, "the situation is handy for my husband, you know. I should not like the thought that he had far to come late at night."</p><p>"Oh! is he ever out late at night? How dreadful! how dull you must be! how wretched for you! I should make my maid sit up and read me to sleep."</p></div> </div>
