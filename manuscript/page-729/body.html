<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Mrs. Schröder's hopes were realised. In the course of the next afternoon a cab drove up to the door in Saxe-Coburg Square, and Mr. Schröder descended from it. His wife, who had rushed to the balcony at the sound of wheels, noticed that his step was slow, and that—a thing she had never seen him do before—he leant upon the cabman's arm. When he entered the room she rushed to him, and, embracing him, asked him how he was.</p><p>"I am well, my darling," he answered; "quite well, but that I have rheumatism, or something like it. A curious pain—dead, dull, stupid pain—in my left arm and shoulder. Rheumatism, of course! And you, Barbara, my dear; you are well? That's right; no news with you, of course? Ah! I have been thinking much about you in the train, and we will talk to-morrow of your affairs. Well, Alice, what news? Did you persuade Barbara to drive yesterday?"</p><p>"No, she refused again; so I went out on horseback."</p></div> </div>
