<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"I've been very busy, Kate, and been unable to come. You know my wish is to come as frequently as possible; oh, you needn't shake your head, because you are quite certain of it; but that's neither here nor there. I keep to my portion of the contract, and shall not bore you about myself until I've shown you I've a right to ask you to listen to me. And now, how are you, and what are you doing? To tell truth, I don't think you look very bonny, young woman: a little dragged, eh? End of the season, perhaps?"</p><p>"Oh, I'm all right!" said Kate, hurriedly; "never better in health, and jolly; that's the great point, isn't it, Simnel, eh? I'm learning to look after number one, you know; and when you can do that, you're all right, ain't you? Have some lunch? No? then look here; I've got something you must taste,â€”some wonderful Madeira. Oh, all right; I know it'll put some colour into your cheeks, and do you good."</p></div> </div>
