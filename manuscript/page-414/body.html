Look here, Simnel," said she, pulling up short; "let's have this out now. I don't like you; I never did, and I never shall! and I don't want you at my place. Do you understand?"</p><p>"Perfectly," said Simnel, with a hard smile; "and yet I think I must come. I want to say something specially particular to you."</p><p>"What about? What you've said before? About yourself?"</p><p>"No," said Simnel, smiling as before; "I never say things twice over. I want to talk to you about a friend of ours—Charles Beresford."</p><p>"Charles Beresford?—what of him?"</p><p>"That's just what I propose to come and tell you."</p><p>Their eyes met. The next instant Kate cast hers down as she said, "I shall be at home on Friday from two till six. You can come then."</p></div> </div>
