<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">memories once more, I'm afraid. You recollect that, while you were at Combcardingham with our old friends Piggott and Wells, you formed an acquaintance with a very pretty girl—a 'hand' in one of the factories? You shake your head, eh? it <em>is</em> a long time since, and these sort of things get pushed from one's mind by other affairs, and—however, I think you'll recollect her when I mention her name. Does the name Ann Moore convey to you—Ah! I thought so! I'll wait a minute, if you please; there's no hurry."</p><p>"Go on, sir; go on!" said Mr. Townshend, whose face was hidden in, and supported by, his hands.</p><p>"An attachment sprung up between you and Ann Moore, I think, which was the cause of great distress to her only relation, a brother, with whom she lived. This brother and you exchanged words—if not blows—on this subject, and the result was that the girl left her brother and went to live with you. Did you speak?"</p></div> </div>
