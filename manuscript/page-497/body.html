<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">presence of Captain Lyster, and the unmistakable evidence of his passion for the young lady, gave Mr. Beresford very little annoyance; he had a notion that, save in very exceptional cases, of which indeed he had had no experience, women had a horror of an earnest lover; that watchings and waitings, hangings on words, deep gazings into eyes, and all outward signs of that passion which induces melancholy and affords themes for poets, were as much <em>rococo</em> and out of date as carrying a lady's glove in your hat and perpetually seeking a fight with some one on her account.
