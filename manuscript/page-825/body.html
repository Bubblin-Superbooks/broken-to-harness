What are you thinking about?"</p><p>"I was thinking," said Mr. Simnel slowly, "that if this Schröder business does not come off,—and I don't think it will,—you'd better send in a certificate from Prater or some one, and get away to the Continent for six months."</p><p>"Well, we'll wait and see what to-day brings forth, at all events.
