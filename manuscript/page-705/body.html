Don't you know that Mrs. Churchill is as much your wife before God and man as she ever was? Don't you feel that she has done nothing for which even the wretched laws which we in our mighty wisdom have chosen to frame would justify you in treating her in this way? I can understand it all; you've been worked upon by the chatter and magging of these silly women until you've lost your own calm common-sense. But don't you feel now, Frank, that I'm right? Don't you feel that a fit of rage, a mere wretched passing temper, is not the thing to separate those whom—you know I use it in no canting sense—those whom God has joined together? Don't you feel that it is your duty to go to her, or to send—I'll go if you like, though it's not a very pleasant office—to point out to her the miserable folly of this course, and to bring her back to her proper place—her home?"</p></div> </div>
