Down go the Spanish castles, away melt the aerial estates; Duty's foot kicks away Alnaschar's basket, and there is the hard, dry, unsympathetic, work-a-day world before him! He will go back to Bissett, but only for a day, just to get his traps together and to make some plausible excuse, and then will start off. This first week of his holiday has been any thing but rest, and rest he requires. He will go to Scarborough—no! not there, for reasons; but to some watering-place, and pitch pebbles into the sea and lie fallow until he is compelled to return to work. Yes, that is the right course—he determines on it finally as the train nears the Brighton station; hopes must be crushed, and Duty must be obeyed.

Frank Churchill has resolved upon doing his duty, and, like the drunkard in the old story, is "treating resolution." )</p></div> </div>
